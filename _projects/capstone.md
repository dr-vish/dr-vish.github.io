**Objectives:**
Cross-sectional validated surveys were administered at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) School of Dentistry (SOD) Pre-doctoral dental clinic to assess satisfaction and pain during COVID-19, 11-2020 through 01-2021.

**Methods:**
English-speaking patients of the UCSF pre-doctoral clinic at SOD who were adults (18+) were eligible. Participants rated satisfaction questions on a Likert scale ranging from "Strongly agree" to "Strongly disagree”. Pain questions were binary values (Yes/No). Pain and satisfaction index levels are created and tested with a paired t-test and Analysis of Variance. Linear and logistic regression models are fit for satisfaction and pain scales. A principal component analysis was performed to validate the regression models.

**Results:**
143 participants completed the survey; 125 participants (86.2%) met the eligibility criteria: 48% (N=60/125) were males, 35.2% were in the most representative age group 26 to 45 years, 75.2% reported delayed receiving dental care and 62.4% of those could not receive dental care when they needed it. The Blacks (β = 5.89, 95% CI [1.37 - 10.41], p = 0.012), and Asian (β = 4.30, 95% CI [0.41 – 8.19], p = 0.031) participants with the presence of pain (B = -3.9, 95% CI [-6.96, -0.91], p = 0.012) and absence of a supportive group of family and friends (95% CI [1.34, 9.76], p = 0.011) were the least satisfied with the dental care they received during the pandemic. Of the 125 eligible for the study, 108 qualified for the pain analyses. After examining the covariates for pain analyses, the population undergoing financial issues (p-value = 0.013) and those who had difficulty traveling to the dentist’s office (p-value = 0.005) were most likely in dental pain during the pandemic.

**Conclusion:** We can conclude from our findings that non-white populations who do not have a supportive group of people are less satisfied with the dental care they receive and are more in pain. We also concluded that the population affected by dental pain included people from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds who had difficulty traveling to the dentist’s office.
