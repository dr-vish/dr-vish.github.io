Welcome to my data-driven world! I'm Vishakha Malhotra, a passionate data scientist, dentist and healthcare researcher with a keen eye for turning raw information into actionable insights. With a background in Health data science and dentistry, I thrive on the challenge of extracting meaning from complex healthcare datasets and translating it into impactful solutions.

My journey in data science began with a curiosity for unraveling patterns and trends within healthcare problems. During my masters, I've honed my skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, leveraging cutting-edge tools and techniques to tackle real-world problems. Whether it's predicting disease outcomes, optimizing business processes, or uncovering hidden correlations, I'm driven by the prospect of using data to drive informed decision-making and create tangible value.

Beyond technical proficiency, I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication. I enjoy working in diverse teams, where different perspectives enrich the problem-solving process and lead to innovative solutions. My ability to translate complex findings into clear, actionable recommendations ensures that insights are not only discovered but also implemented effectively.

When I'm not immersed in data, you can find me exploring new techniques, staying updated on the latest advancements in the field, or sharing my knowledge through writing and mentoring. I'm committed to continuous learning and growth, always seeking new challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible with data science.

Join me on this journey as we navigate the vast landscape of data, uncovering hidden gems and transforming information into impact, one insight at a time.
